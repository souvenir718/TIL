# Off My Face - Justin Bieber (21.07.05)

One touch and you got me stoned

**워언트치애뉴갇미스토온**

Higher than I've ever known

**하이어대네버어노온**

You call the shots and I follow

**유컬더샤아츠애나fㅏㄹ어어**

Sunrise, but the night still young

**써언라이ㅈ벋드나읻스띠려엉**

No words, but we speak in tongues

**노월ㅈ.벋위스피키인터어ㅈ**

If you let me, I might say too much

**이f유레엗미 아맡세이투머어어ㅊ**

Your touch blurred my vision

**여어터어치브ㄹ럳마아비젼**

It's your world and I'm just in it

**츄얼월댄암저스티니잇**

Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

**이이븐소버람낫띤키인스트레이** 

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you

**커자암오ㅂ마아페이s인러어ㅂ위이드유**

I'm out my head, so into you

**아아마웃마아헫소이인ㅌ유우**

And I don't know how you do it

**애나도오노오하아유두잇**

But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

**버다암포오레버루인바아이유우 우우우**



Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed

**캔슬립커즈암웨이트버ㅈ**

Too late, now you're in my blood

**투-레읻나유인마아블러ㄷ**

I don't hate the way you keep me up

**도온헤잍더웨이이유킵미어어업**

Your touch blurred my vision

**여어터어치브ㄹ럳마아비젼**

It's your world and I'm just in it

**츄얼월댄암저스티니잇**

Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

**이이븐소버람낫띤키인스트레~~이** 

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you

**커자암오ㅂ마아페이s인러어ㅂ위이드유**

I'm out my head, so into you

**아아마웃마아헫소이인ㅌ유우**

And I don't know how you do it

**애나도오노오하아유두잇**

But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

**버다암포오레버루인바아이유우 우우우**

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you

**커자암오ㅂ마아페이s인러어ㅂ위이드유**

I'm out my head, so into you

**아아마웃마아헫소이인ㅌ유우**

And I don't know how you do it

**애나도오노오하아유두잇**

But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

**버다암포오레버루인바아이유우 우우우**

By you, ooh-ooh-ooh
