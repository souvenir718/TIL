# A great big world - Say something(21.08.02)

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

I'll be the one, if you want me to

**아아위비드원 이퓨워언미투**

Anywhere I would've followed you

**애니웨엘 아이 우드fㅏ러ㄷ유**

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

And I am feeling so small

**앤다아이 필링쏘오스머얼**

It was over my head

**이워어ㅈ어어벌마헤엗**

I know nothing at all

**(아이)노나씨잉에더얼**

And I will stumble and fall

**앤다아이 위스터엄브래앤퍼얼**

I'm still learning to love

**암스띠러어닝트러업**

Just starting to crawl

**저슽스따알링크러얼**

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you

**쏘오리댓아이쿠디인게트유**

Anywhere I would've followed you

**애니웨엘 아이 우드fㅏ러ㄷ유**

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

And I will swallow my pride

**앤다아이 위스와러마아이 프라읻**

You're the one that I love

**유얼드원 대다러업**

And I'm saying goodbye

**세잉굿바아이**

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you

**(애남)쏘오리대아이쿠디인게트유**

And anywhere I would've followed you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

**앤애니웨엘 아아이 우드fㅏ러어ㄷ유**

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

Say something, I'm giving up on you

**세이써엄띵암기비잉어퍼뉴**

Say something...
