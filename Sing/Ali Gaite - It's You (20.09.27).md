# Ali Gaite - It's You (20.09.27)

It's you / it's always you /

If I'm ever gonna fall in love / I know it's gonna be you /

It's you / it's always you /

Met a lot of people but no / body feels like you

So / please don't break my heart /

Don't tear me apart /

I know how it starts,/ trust me I've been broken before /

Don't break me again, / I am delicate /

Please don't break my heart /

Trust me I've been broken before /



I've been broken yeah / I know how it feels /

To be open/ and then find out your love isn't real /

I'm still hurting / yeah I'm hurting inside /

I'm so scared to fall in love but if it's for you then I will try /



It's you / it's always you /

If I'm ever gonna fall in love / I know it's gonna be you /

It's you / it's always you /

Met a lot of people but no / body feels like you 

So / please don't break my heart /

Don't tear me apart /

I know how it starts,/ trust me I've been broken before /

Don't break me again, / I am delicate /

Please don't break my heart /

Trust me I've been broken before /
