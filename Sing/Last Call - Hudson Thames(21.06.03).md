# Last Call - Hudson Thames(21.06.03)

Da da da da da da da da da da

다아라따아라다아라리다리라

Another song about getting drunk

나더서엉 게딩드러엉ㅋ

I know you've heard it all before but honey loosen up

노유허리 아브퍼비허니루즈너엎

Roundabouts and ups and downs

라드바아우ㅊ (앤)업슨다아우ㄴs

Yea, we've all been on a journey but we're here right now

예위버빈오너저니버위히어라이나우

It's too late for conversation

투레이잇 컨벌세이션

My mind is on vacation

마마아인이젼버케이션

I've been counting seconds to the weekend (weekend)

아빈카우닝세컨ㅈ투드위이캔ㄷ

Cheap wine in public places

치파인드인퍼블릭플레이ㅅ

Good friends and bad locations

구프렌진배로케이션

Tell me what do you want

테엘미와유워언ㅌ

So tonight, lets get high

쏘우투나아잇 레쓰겟하아이

Pass that joint and kill that vibe

패애스댓조이댄킬대앳바아입

We might laugh, we might cry

위이마아래애f위마이크라아이

Middle fingers to the sky

미들피잉걸s투드스카아이

Oh, I don't even know if I've had nights like this

오오아돈이븐노이파나이츠라잌디스

I don't even know how many girls I've kissed

아돈이븐노하매니걸s아이키스ㄷ

Tonight, lets get high

트은나아잇레스겟하아이

Middle fingers to the sky

미들피잉걸s투드스카아이

We'll be fine

위를비파이인

Da da da da da da da da da da



Golden days may have changed



But the boys down in the valley always stay the same



Another line to pass the time



We've been singing here for hours now it's closing time



Now lets wake up and make that money



Laugh hard when shit ain't funny



Gotta miss the days when we were younger



You feel the way I'm feeling



Glasses up to the ceiling



We're gonna be alright



So tonight, lets get high



Pass that joint and kill that vibe



We might laugh, we might cry



Middle fingers to the sky



Oh, I don't even know if I've had nights like this



I don't even know how many girls I've kissed



Tonight, lets get high



Middle fingers to the sky



We'll be fine



We never know what we got til it's gone



Nights looking crazy but that makes us strong



Tell me you love me



I'll tell you you're wrong



Ladies, fellas, let me hear you sing along



Da da da da da da da da da da (woo there we go)



Da da da da da da da da da da



So tonight, lets get high



Pass that joint and kill that vibe



We might laugh, we might cry



Middle fingers to the sky



Oh, I don't even know if I've had nights like this



I don't even know how many girls I've kissed



Tonight, lets get high



Middle fingers to the sky



We'll be fine



Da da da da da da da da da da (we'll be fine)



Da da da da da da da da da da
