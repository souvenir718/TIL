# Come thru - Jeremy Zucker(21.07.19)

I might lose my mind

**아맛루즈마마-인ㄷ**

Waking when the sun's down

**웨이킨웬드서언ㅈ다운**

Riding all these highs

**라디너디즈하-이스**

Waiting for the comedown

**웨잇인퍼더커-엄다운**

Walk these streets with me

**웤디스스트리츠윗미**

I'm doing decently

**두잉디이슨리**

Just glad that I can breathe, yeah

**저슽글랟댓아캔브리 예에**

I'm trying to realize

**암트라이인트리이얼라잊**

It's alright to not be fine

**이처얼라이트 나앗비파아아인**

On your own

**오오뉴우오오오오온**

Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee

**나우암쉐이키인드린킨얼디스커어피**

These last few weeks have been exhausting

**디스라아s피유우윜s해빈잌져어스팅**

I'm lost in my imagination

**암로오스틴마아이메지네에이셔어언**

And there's one thing that I need from you

**앤데스원.띵대아닏프로뮤**

Can you come through

**캐뉴커엄 뜨루후우~**

And there's one thing that I need from you

**앤데스원.띵대아닏프로뮤**

Can you come through

**캐뉴컴.뜨루**

Ain't got much to do



Too old for my hometown



Went to bed at noon



Couldn't put my phone down



Scrolling patiently



It's all the same to me



Just faces on a screen, yeah



I'm trying to realize



It's alright to not be fine



On your own



Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee



These last few weeks have been exhausting



I'm lost in my imagination



And there's one thing that I need from you



Can you come through



And there's one thing that I need from you



Can you come through



And there's one thing that I need from you



Can you come through
